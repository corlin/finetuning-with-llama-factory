# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically updating the README.md documentation to accurately reflect the current state of the LLaMA Factory Finetuning project for Qwen3-4B-Thinking model. The project has evolved significantly with comprehensive features including expert evaluation systems, distributed training, model export capabilities, Chinese NLP processing, cryptography term handling, and extensive monitoring tools. The current README.md is outdated and doesn't reflect the full scope of capabilities available in the project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer exploring this project, I want comprehensive and accurate documentation in the README.md, so that I can quickly understand the project's full capabilities and get started effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the README.md THEN the system SHALL provide a complete overview of all major features including expert evaluation, distributed training, model export, Chinese NLP processing, and cryptography term handling
2. WHEN a user looks at the project structure THEN the system SHALL display an accurate directory structure that reflects the current codebase organization
3. WHEN a user reviews the feature list THEN the system SHALL include all implemented capabilities such as thinking data processing, expert evaluation framework, distributed training engine, model export tools, and performance optimization features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user setting up the project, I want clear and accurate installation and setup instructions, so that I can get the project running without confusion or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows the installation steps THEN the system SHALL provide accurate commands for uv package manager setup and dependency installation
2. WHEN a user runs the setup process THEN the system SHALL reference the correct setup scripts and configuration files that exist in the project
3. WHEN a user needs to verify their setup THEN the system SHALL provide working commands to check environment status and validate installation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the project, I want detailed usage examples and configuration guidance, so that I can effectively utilize all the project's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to run training THEN the system SHALL provide examples for both single-GPU and distributed training scenarios
2. WHEN a user needs to configure the system THEN the system SHALL document all major configuration options including model settings, LoRA parameters, training parameters, and multi-GPU settings
3. WHEN a user wants to use advanced features THEN the system SHALL provide examples for expert evaluation, model export, Chinese NLP processing, and cryptography term handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user exploring project capabilities, I want to understand the available demo programs and examples, so that I can learn how to use different features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user looks for examples THEN the system SHALL document all available demo programs in the examples directory
2. WHEN a user wants to run demonstrations THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for executing demo programs like comprehensive finetuning, expert evaluation, and model export demos
3. WHEN a user needs to understand demo outputs THEN the system SHALL explain what each demo produces and how to interpret results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting issues, I want comprehensive troubleshooting guidance and references to additional documentation, so that I can resolve problems efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user encounters problems THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance for common issues including CUDA memory problems, dependency conflicts, and configuration errors
2. WHEN a user needs detailed documentation THEN the system SHALL reference the comprehensive documentation available in the docs directory
3. WHEN a user wants to understand project architecture THEN the system SHALL provide links to relevant architectural documentation and guides

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contributor or maintainer, I want the README.md to accurately reflect the project's current version and capabilities, so that the documentation stays synchronized with the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README.md is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the current project version and feature set as defined in pyproject.toml
2. WHEN new features are documented THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency with the actual implemented functionality
3. WHEN configuration examples are provided THEN the system SHALL use actual configuration values from the configs/config.yaml file
